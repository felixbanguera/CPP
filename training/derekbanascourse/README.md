Each *.cpp file can be run in console once g++ is installed. For Mac OS just install xcode.

1. within the terminal run the following to compile a file:

  g++ -std=c++11 file_name.cpp
2. and after that, run:

  ./a.out
3. You can run each file just changing the file name.


The following are the topics according to the file names, which are named like that for simplicity on compilation.

- Part1.cpp : Variable assignation, data types, Basic operators, Shortcuts for increment and casting example.
- Part2.cpp : If statement
- Part3.cpp : Switch statement
- Part4.cpp : Ternary Operator
- Part5.cpp : Arrays and For loops
- Part6.cpp : While loops and Do-While loops
- Part7.cpp : Strings and string methods
- Part8.cpp : Vectors
- Part9.cpp : Functions
- Part10.cpp : File I/O
- Part11.cpp : Pointers
- Part12.cpp : Classes
- Part13.cpp : Inheritance
- Part14.cpp : Polymorphism
